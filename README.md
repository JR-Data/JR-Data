- 👋 Hi, my name is Jai!
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a more adept python programmer and data analyst.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about data science and blockchain technologies. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on python projects, data analysis datasets, and marketing projects (I also work in SEO and have several clients in different fields). 
- 📫 You can reach me here on Github, at jairandh@gmail.com, or 916-757-2081 for any more information!
